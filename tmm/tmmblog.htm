    <p class="blogpost">I wanted to start off with a little about my self and why I wanted to create this 
        website and blog. My name is Brittany and I am a 30 year old mother of one. I am also a homemaker who 
        homeschools. I have intentionally untreated ADHD, I'm from a broken home, and learned very little about 
        homemaking before I was married. As you can imagine all of this together made giving my husband and son
        the home, wife, and mother I wanted to give them seem like an impossiable task at first. I am not going
        to lie and say that I have found the secret and have it all figured out. However I have learned some 
        tricks that I hope to share with you to make your journey to being the homemaker you wish to be a 
        little easier.
        <br><br>
        From list and charts to how to make your hyperfixations work toward your homemaking goals. Along with 
        some pratical how to's for the women out there like me who barely knew where to start, what I hope to 
        acomplish is bringing everything I have learned over the years and what I will learn in the future into
        one spot so that it might be a little eaiser on someone else. Remember that we all start somewhere, 
        none of us have it all together, and you have to figure out what works best for you in the season you 
        are in.</p>
