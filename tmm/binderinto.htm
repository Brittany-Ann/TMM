    Binder Intro
</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>An Introduction</h1>
    <p>The first thing I need to talk about is my home management binder. As someone with ADHD, it just helps<br> 
    to have everything written down and in one place. I also use an app on my phone, but I'll talk more <br> 
    about that when I write about planning out my day. Another good thing about going over this first is <br> 
    that it gives me a chance to say that homemaking is about so much more than just cleaning, even  <br> if 
    that is a big (and never-ending) part of it. Homemaking is the art of creating a feeling or an 
    atmosphere. <br>  While we may all want around the same things from this peace, comfort, welcoming the way 
    we achive <br>  this will not always be the same.
    <br><br>
    Now we have that out of the way lets get into it. I bought a cute binder for this because it brings me <br>  
    joy; 
    you can use whatever you like. I see nothing wrong with starting out with a home management <br>  notebook. I also 
    created cover pages and labels to separate the different sections. Part of the reason <br>  I have such a cool binder
    is because I luckily went through a phase where homemaking was a <br> hyper-fixation of mine. If that's not you, 
    it's ok; no one has to do all of the things. There are plenty of things and systems I just <br> don't get into.
    <br><br>
    ⚫The first section in my home management binder is the cleaning section. Here I keep a master copy and a current
    copy of my daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly (separated by season) lists. I also have blank copies of all 
    these lists for when I need to make changes or when I have worn out or marked up the one I am using.
    <br><br>
    ⚫ Next, I have my self-care list here. I simply keep copies of my morning and nighttime self-care lists. I also 
    keep blanks of these because I change what I do frequently to avoid it feeling like a chore.
    <br><br>
    ⚫Then I have my shopping section, which is exactly what it sounds like: my shopping lists and blanks.
    <br><br>
    ⚫Next, I have my home office section. This is where I keep the things I need to keep the more business 
    administration-type things. Budgets, logins, and passwords—anything official I need on hand for some reason 
    goes here.
    <br><br>
    ⚫Following that, I have my meal planning section. It contains my meal plan as well as a section for me to keep 
    track of what new recipes I want to try and how well they were received.
    <br><br>
    ⚫I also have a section to keep a kitchen inventory. It might sound silly, but it helps me not to keep buying 
    the same things and saves money when I can "shop" my kitchen when making my meal plan.
    <br><br>
    ⚫I then have a section to keep all of my DIY ideas and the "recipes" for them. I also keep up with what worked 
    for me so that I know I won't get the same idea a few years from now just to keep trying things that didn't 
    really pan out for one reason or another. I am just not good at it is not a good reason. I just don't like it 
    is.
    <br><br>
    ⚫Then I have my goals section. I put anything I want to work toward here, along with my plan for getting there. 
    I also keep all the pages from old goals, whether I met them or not, so I can look back on them.
    <br><br>
    ⚫Next to last is my holiday planning section. It has my meal plans for the holidays, shopping list, and baking 
    list. 
    <br><br>
    ⚫ Finally, I have my make-ahead and freezer meal sections. Here I keep a list of what I have, recipes, and things
    I want to make. 
    <br><br>
    Thank you for your interest. The rest of it will be more fun. I just wanted to get the intro out of the way. I 
    know that this may seem like a lot. You do not have to put it all together at once, and you are doing most of 
    these things anyway. It can really help to take some time out to organize it and put it on paper to save the 
    mental space for other things you need or want to do. I hope this helps. Over the next few weeks, I am going 
    to be spending more time on cleaning and how I use my ADHD to help me keep the mundane fun.</p>
